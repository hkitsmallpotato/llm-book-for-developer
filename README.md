# LLM based GenAI app for developer

*I've always thought, it'd be nice if there's a book that can cater to both the science and engineering of LLM based GenAI app...*

So here's an honest attempt. May have some technical mistakes, doesn't matter - just try your best. And remember that in the wild west that is LLM, any thing might happen.

## Intended Audience

- Software Developers coming from non AI fields who want to pivots.
- Same as above, but just want to dabble and play around, that's also okay too!

## Method

- First, a list of references, resources, etc are collected and curated by searching on the internet.
- Separately, a proposed course/book outline is manually produced based on the author's personal taste.
- (TODO) ... Ask AI to auto-generate a book based on condensed summary of the references? (!)
- (TODO) may also mix in some of the codes I wrote myself before in this area
- ... not necessarily profit, but fun!

## What to do

Currently only a very early draft.

Look around the repo, specifically, check out the `biblio/references.md` doc in Bibliography section - there is a long list of links there.
