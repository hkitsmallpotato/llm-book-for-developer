# General resources

## For beginner

- https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks
  - A video series by the famous youtuber 3blue1brown for math with nice illustration and easy to understand explanation. Start from the basics of neural network, then quickly go to attention mechanism and transformer. Suitable for beginner.
- https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1
  - Coding focused course for NLP (Natural Language Processing) by huggingface. Huggingface is like "The github for ML/AI", and they also have a suite of libraries and frameworks for doing AI. (One of the most important one is `transformers`, a high level library that makes it easier to run AI models by having standardized pipeline. It supports using pytorch or tensorflow as backend)
- https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/
  - Organized by a team of UC Berkeley PhD alumni with years of industry experience. The course is created back in the early days of LLM. Contains a good amount of goodies and oriented towards developers. The call to action is (quoting them) "Now, a compelling MVP based on pretrained LLM models and APIs can be configured and serving users in an hour", and that's part of what makes LLM so exciting despite its limitations.
